# Discord-Presence-Simulator (DPS)
Simulates Discord Presence

Current Version: 0.5
([Update Log](https://github.com/Minac2503/Discord-Presence-Simulator/blob/master/UpdateLog.md))

DPS will simulate to discord that you're playing a game, but one of which you yourself have set up.
It can be literally anything.

In order to use DPS, you just first create an application by pressing the "Create Presence" button in DPS.
Once you've done that, the rest of the setup should be easy.

I've tried to make DPS as user friendly as possible, but it still requires a little bit of knowledge.

Need help with anything? Maybe our [Wiki](https://github.com/Minac2503/Discord-Presence-Simulator/wiki) can help you out.
***
## Known Bugs:
- Status text may show "connected" even if not connected.
- DPS's fake presence may clash with any other program's presence. (Example: You'll see what DPS is showing, but others will see the real game/application)
***
## Before Full Release (v1.0):
I plan to to add templates for easy use, with the ability to use a custom presence like you do now.
